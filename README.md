# Activity-Recognition-using-Machine-Learning

Hello Reader,
Happy that you are reading this. This is a mini project kind of assignmnet which i made in my 1st Sem, would be happy if this helps you in any context.
So, in this we will we using some classification Machine Learning models such as KNN, Decision Tree to figure out some specific action of users described in the data description as they are wearing a single chest mounted accelerometer, to generate the dataset avaiable on UCI Website. In the end we will conclude which model works better and why?. 
These are some of the activity/actions to be predicted :-
--- 1: Working at Computer
--- 2: Standing Up, Walking and Going updown stairs
--- 3: Standing
--- 4: Walking
--- 5: Going UpDown Stairs
--- 6: Walking and Talking with Someone
--- 7: Talking while Standing
