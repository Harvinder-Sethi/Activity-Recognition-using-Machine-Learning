# Activity-Recognition-using-Machine-Learning

Hello Reader,
In this we will we using some classification Machine Learning models such as KNN, Decision Tree to figure out some specific action of users described in the data description as they are wearing a single chest mounted accelerometer, to generate the dataset avaiable on UCI Website 15 dataset are available. In the end we will conclude which model works better and why?. 
These are some of the activity/actions to be predicted :-
--- 1: Working at Computer
--- 2: Standing Up, Walking and Going updown stairs
--- 3: Standing
--- 4: Walking
--- 5: Going UpDown Stairs
--- 6: Walking and Talking with Someone
--- 7: Talking while Standing

NOTE:- You can download my Presentation, Report and .ipynb file to better understand what is being done. Open the file in Jupyter Notebook using python Goto Kernel and select Restart Kernel and run all cells. Please keep a note of the 15 File names, it should be the same.
